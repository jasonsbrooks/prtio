1) Use ajax on searching for songs on page to return a popdown (using select2.js) of returned results.  Select song from that list, and add it using ajax+ID from that method.  It makes it more personal, since on the computer, it's much easier to search for songs.
2) Fix cue so that on page refresh, it doesn't all delete.
3) DESIGNS, DESIGNS, DESIGNS
4) Maybe clean up player a little bit, add song queue on right side, use asynchronus callbacks to do this
5) List of parties page
